## 👥 System Roles

The system has three main roles with different access levels:

### Regular User
Customers are the beating heart of the bank and have access to a full range of financial services:

- 🔑 **Sign-up and Login:** Users sign up in the system with their mobile number.
  > Note: The password must be strong and include a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

- 🛡️ **Identity Verification:** For complete security, all account features remain disabled until identity is verified by the support team.

- 💰 **Account Management:** Includes instant account top-up, viewing the current balance, and receiving a complete list of transactions with the ability to sort by date and filter by a time range.

- 📞 **Contact Management:** Users can add, edit, and manage their contact list for faster money transfers.

- 📈 **Investment Funds:**
  - **Savings Fund:** A virtual account for simple money storage and management.
  - **Remainder Fund:** A smart way to save small change; after each transaction, the remaining amount is rounded up and deposited into this fund.
  - **Reward Fund:** A fixed-term investment fund that deposits a fixed monthly interest into the user's main account.

- 📱 **SIM Card Top-up:** Ability to buy mobile credit for any number, the user's own number, or one of the saved contacts.

- 💸 **Money Transfer:** Users can transfer money to an **account number**, **card number**, or **contacts** (if the contact is mutual).
